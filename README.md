# Introduction 
"Data Analysis: Investigating Netflix Movies" is a project made by Datacamp to help us apply from both of the course "Introduction Python" and "Intermediate Python"

### Situation:
We want to do some research on movies released in the 1990's. Datacamp has provided us with a dataset. We will explore Netflix movie data and perform exploratory data analysis for a production company to uncover insights about movies from this decade.

This project is aimed at self-learning, with detailed steps written in the Jupyter Notebook file. In this project, I will use both English and Vietnamese to review in the future.
